1.PT switching
- Positive: when you switch your PT to INT before using a spell (Good) - show how much mana was saved from that
- Negative: when you use a spell with a PT not on INT - show how much mana could have been saved from that

is it important that PT was switched back?

mana = 900/1000; spell1 = 100; spell2 = 200
1. No PT switch: 900 - 100 = 800 (no mana saved)
2. PT switched once:
   1. 900 + 120*0.9 = 1008
   2. 1008 - 100 = 908 (8 mana saved)
3. PT switched back
   1.  900 + 120*0.9 = 1008 (/1120)
   2.  1008 - 100 = 908 (/1120)
   3.  908/1120 * 1000 = 810 (10 mana saved)
4. PT switched once (double spell)
   1. 900 + 120*0.9 = 1008
   2. 1008 - 100 = 908
   3. 908 - 200 = 708 (8 mana saved)
5. PT switched back (double spell)
   1. 900 + 120*0.9 = 1008
   2. 1008 - 100 = 908
   3. 908 - 200 = 708
   4. 708/1120 * 1000 = 632 (32 mana saved)
6. PT double switched
   1.

Rules:
1. If PT switched and then any mana was spent in the next 10 secs = show mana savings from that switch (gained savings)
2. If PT switched and then any mana was spend and the PT was switched back from INT within 10 secs = show mana savings from that switch (gained savings)
3. If any mana was spent without PT on INT show how much mana could have been saved with a quick switch (missed savings)

Low mana stats:
1. Look at mana dips: how low does mana dip between full manas
2. Look at time spent below some % of mana (20/50)

Potential:
1. Show Low mana stats with perfect PT usage

Note:
1. If there are no potenital savings is because you spent the whole game with PT on INT
2. If your hero is INT then maybe not a mistake (bonus damage)
3. We could show the time you spent not attacking or using spells while receiving damage as missed HP opportunity

Rating:
1. All time on INT - perfect rating??
   1. Does not make sense for non-int heroes
   2. Does not even make sense for many INT heroes
   3. what about universal heroes?
2. Always switching before spell - perfect rating?
3. Rating = mana saved / all potential mana saved




PT has 3 uses:
1. STR = when damaged (and not spending mana or attacking)
2. AGI = when farming/damaging (and not spending mana or being damanged)
3. INT = when spending mana (and not damanged)
4. MAIN ATTR = when farming/damaging (and not spending mana or being damanged)
5. NON-STR = when healing (and not being damaged and not DPS-ing for STR-heroes)
6. NON-INT = when gaining mana (and not using mana and not DPS-ing for INT-heroes)
